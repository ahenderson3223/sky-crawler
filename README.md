# SkyCrawler

A webapp to help satellite observers by displaying satellite and weather forecasting information.

# Project Status

The simple functionality has been completed. Users can input a location (in terms of coordinates) or simply allow the app to access their current location. Users can select a satellite. Then, SkyCrawler displays satellite passes at that location for the next 10 days, along with the weather information for those days.

The website currently is not being hosted, but screenshots can be found below:
